Project Logos - User Stories

Who are your users?
What are they going to do on website?
Why are they going to use your website?

Write out examples in complete sentences/thoughts.

Users: Layman, Clergy, Students/studiers, Teachers

As any user, I would like to be able to type in a section of the Bible: books, chapters, or verses, and select two translations and have them displayed side by side

As a layman, I would like to see the difference two different translations of the Bible side by side to easily see what the differences are and to help me better understand the verses.

As a pastor, I would like to be able to easily compare and contrast different translations of the Bible for teaching my congregation.

As a user, I would like to change how the text is displayed, either side by side, or interlacing the two different translations.

As a user, I would like to be able to type the section I want to read in shorthand to more quickly bring up the text.

As a user, I would like clear/concise instructions on how to use website.
